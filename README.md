# AndrÃ© GonÃ§alves

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Oi! Hola! Iâ€™m AndrÃ©. 

I was born and raised in a small town in Brazil called PoÃ§os de Caldas (state of Minas Gerais), but Iâ€™ve spent most of my life in South Florida (anywhere between West Palm and Ft. Lauderdale). Iâ€™m currently living in St Thomas, in the US Virgin Islands.

Iâ€™ve been a tinkerer since I was a little kid. I knew I wanted to work with computers ever since my family bought our first one, back in the early 90s. I was fascinated by the idea that machine instructions could be converted into interactable programs. I started learning QBasic (mostly by tinkering with [GORILLA.BAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)) and [NIBBLES.BAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbles_(video_game))). After finishing High School in Brazil I moved to the US and earned a Computer Engineering degree from Florida Atlantic University. Since graduation Iâ€™ve worked with both hardware and software, both as a software engineer and product manager.
